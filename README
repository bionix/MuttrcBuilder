muttrcbuilder version 0.01
==========================

This is the code used to run http://www.muttrcbuilder.org/. It provides
an easy way to create muttrc files for the mutt email client
(http://www.mutt.org/).

The builder uses a series of modules under Mutt::Config to load
information on configuration variables supported by different versions
of mutt - actual information is under Mutt::Config::Version.

The main builder CGI script is in doc/builder-cgi.pl

There is a program to take a mutt manual.xml and manual.txt and turn
it into a Mutt::Config::Version module, in bin/mutt_config_write_module

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install
   cp doc/builder-cgi.pl /var/www/cgi-bin/

DEPENDENCIES

These programs require perl v5.6.0 or greater.

The mutt_config_write_module script requires XML::LibXML, XML::LibXSLT
and the lynx web browser in your path.
