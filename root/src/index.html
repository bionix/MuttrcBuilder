   This site lets you create a <tt>muttrc</tt> configuration file for
   the <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt email program</a>. You
   specify your preferences in the boxes on the next few pages, and
   you get a muttrc you can use.
 </p>
 <p>
   None of the data you enter is stored permanently, but as the
   Internet is not secure, <strong>you should not enter any sensitive
   information such as passwords</strong>. Enter a placeholder instead
   (such as &quot;password goes here&quot; and replace it in the file
   you download.
 </p>
 <p>
   The idea is based on netliberte's sadly-defunct muttrc builder.

 <h2>Ready? Let's Begin</h2>
 <p>
   To start, please select which version of mutt you want to generate
   a config file for. If your version isn't listed, select the one
   with the closest version number.
 </p>

 <form method="post" action="<% $c->uri_for("/page") %>">
   <p>
     <select name="version">
% foreach my $v (sort @$versions) {
       <option value="<% $v | h %>">mutt-<% $v | h %></option>
% }
     </select>
     <input type="submit" value="Next" />
   </p>
 </form>
